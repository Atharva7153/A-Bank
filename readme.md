# Abank - The Most Trustworthy Parody Bank Ever!

## Overview
Welcome to **Abank**, a satirical banking web application designed to bring humor into the world of finance! This project features an interactive banking experience with a fun twist—horrible customer service, ridiculous policies, and a guaranteed lack of trust. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project offers a functional (and dysfunctional) banking interface.

## Features
### General Features:
- **Sign Up System**: Users can register with their name, DOB, gender, and a custom banking PIN.
- **Homepage Dashboard**: Displays user details along with humorous banking news and policies.
- **Banking Functionalities**:
  - Deposit Money (Instant but pointless!)
  - Withdraw Money (Processing time: 3-5 business decades!)
  - Transfer Money (If you’re lucky!)
  
### Unique Satirical Elements:
- **Zero Customer Support**: A chatbot that ignores queries.
- **Hidden Fees**: Random charges like "Breathing While Banking."
- **AI Chatbot Advice**: "Bro, Just Get Rich."
- **Security Innovations**: Bank steals your money before hackers can.



## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the web pages
- **CSS**: Styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript**: Handling user interactions and data storage

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click "Proceed" to go to the Signup page.
3. Enter your details and create an account.
4. Click "Submit" to be redirected to the homepage.
5. Enjoy (or suffer) the Abank experience!

## Notes & Future Improvements
- Improve data validation in the signup form.
- Add local storage functionality for persistent user data.
- Implement actual banking logic (but that would ruin the joke!).
